       <h1>Hi, I'm Wang Shida(汪铈达).</h1>
       <p> I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at Math Department, National University of Singapore (NUS). <br>
              I'm fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://blog.nus.edu.sg/qianxiaoli/">Li Qianxiao</a>.
              Before that, I studied applied math at Fudan University. <br>
              My research interests are about sequence modelling in machine learning, nonlinear systems and corresponding control algorithms. </p>
