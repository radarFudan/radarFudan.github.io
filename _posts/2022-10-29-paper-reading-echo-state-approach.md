## Paper 

[The “echo state” approach to analysing and training recurrent neural networks – with an Erratum note](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/uploads/EchoStatesTechRep.pdf)

## What is the problem/phenemenon?

This paper study the echo state property in recurrent neural network. The treatment is in discrete time. 

## Why do we study it?



## Contribution of this paper / Main result of this paper?

1. If we require the RNN to be stable for zero constant input, then the stable networks' weight matrix must have a maximum singular value smaller than 1. 

2.

## Numerical experiments:

1. Mackey-Glass system

## Question

1. Is it possible to give a new training scheme for RNN via control method? 


## Reference

1. Adaptive Nonlinear System Identification with Echo State Networks 2002

RLS: recursive least square, a method for fast online adaptation known from linear systems

2. Short term memory in echo state networks 2002

A quantitative measure MC of short term memory capacity is introduced. 

Proposition 2: The memory capacity for recalling an i.i.d. input by a N-unit RNN with linear output units is bounded by N.
