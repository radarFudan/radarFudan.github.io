I basically order every topic in time order. And in these topics, I put some references(also in chronological order). 

## Pascal (Algorithms)

I started this part relatively early, when I was a fifth year primary school student. And this journey lasts for about four years. It's a charming experience to take part in thoses algorithm trainings and compertitions. I really really learned a lot from these experiences. They are not only about knowledge and techniques, but also related to how to face *failure* and challenges. 

### Reference

1. Various unknown textbooks (Sorry to forget the specific names)

2. Various online judgement system (**tyvj**)

3. Introduction to algorithms (I watched the MIT open course during undergradaute winter vacation)

4. https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gilbert/CS5234/ (TODO)

## Matlab / Python (Machine Learning)

When I was a freshman at university, I learned about the famous Machine Learning topic from various resourse. So I started with the Machine Learning MOOC to learn about this topic and it is interesting and delightful. Yes, I got stuck in the backpropogation task for two weeks. <br>
Later on, I was fortunate to get the opportunity to take an internship at Megvii, which allows me to get hands on Machine Learning techniques applied to Computer Vision. I started to use python more and more since that time. 

### Reference

1. [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

2. [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org)

3. Various Machine Learning paper! 

## Haskell (Functional Programming)



### Reference

1. [CS16100](http://cmsc-16100.cs.uchicago.edu/2020-autumn/)

2. [CS242](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~kfisher/teaching.html) (TODO)

## C/C++ (Object-oriented Programming and Operating System)



`gdb` and `vim` are two most important tools I picked up during the OS courses. 

### Reference

1. C programming language (I believe it's the eternal classic!)

2. Accelerate C++ (C++ Primer, Effective C++)

3. [OSTEP](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)

4. [OSDev](https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page)

## SQLite (Database System)

I started to get interested in this topic because I read about an introduction passage on CMU 15-445 module.
