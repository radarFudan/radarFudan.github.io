Topics are ordered in time order. And for each topic, I put some references (also in chronological order).

## Pascal (Data Structures and Algorithms)

I started this part relatively early, when I was a fifth-year primary school student. And this journey lasts for about four years. It's a charming experience to take part in algorithm competitions. I really really learned a lot from these experiences. They are not only about knowledge and techniques, but also about to how to face _failure_ and challenges.

### Reference for Pascal

1. Various textbooks, for example Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen and Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick.

2. Various online judgement system (**tyvj** and **usaco**)

3. Introduction to algorithms (MIT open course)

4. [CS5234 at NUS](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gilbert/CS5234/)

5. [CS6234 at NUS](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs6234/2009/)

6. [CS 97SI: Introduction to Programming Contests](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs97si/) (TODO)

## Matlab / Python (Machine Learning)

When I was a freshman at university, I learned about the famous Machine Learning topic from various resourses. I started with the Machine Learning MOOC on Coursera to learn about this topic and it is interesting and delightful. <br>
Later on, I was fortunate to get the opportunity to take an internship at Megvii, which allows me to get hands on Machine Learning techniques applied to Computer Vision / Computer Graphics. I started to use Python more since that time. <br>
And lots of online modules helped me broaden the horizon and improve the techniques.  <br>
Later on, when I need to decide the direction of my Ph.D. study, I met my supervisor and found his work interesting. Then I decide to learn more about this area. <br>

## Haskell (Functional Programming)

*Map*, *reduce*, *filter* are some concepts still in my mind after three years.

It's hard to try to understand things like *Monad*.

### Reference

4. [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (TODO)

## C/C++ (Object-oriented Programming and Operating System)

When I was at undergraduate at Fudan, it's not so convenient to go from Handan campus to Zhangjiang campus to take the operating system. The time on trip takes more than half an hour. Maybe it's existence of the early offer, I have plenty of time to learn things like OS and take intern at Megvii when I was a senior.

`gdb` and `vim` are two most important tools I picked up during the OS courses. Also the rumination on xv6 is helpful to understand the basic structures of operating system.

### Reference

1. C programming language (I believe it's the eternal classic!)

## SQLite (Database System)

I started to get interested in this topic because I read about an introduction passage on CMU 15-445 module.
