## General

Use `""" content """` to denote docstring in python code. Good for module writing!

Use F-Strings to format strings

    key = 'my_var'
    value = 1.234
    formatted = f'{key}={value}'
    print(formatted)
    formatted = f'{key!r:<10}={value:.2f}'
    print(formatted)
    # Here <10 means left alignment and totally length 10

    places = 3
    number = 1.23456
    print(f'My number is {number:.{places}f}')

    from functools import wraps
    def trace(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            print(f'func.__name__(args!r, kwargs!r)
                 'f'->results!r')
            return result
        return wrapper

    @trace

### Class

## Package specific

`pip freeze` will produce a similar list of the installed packages, but the output uses the format that `pip install` expects. A common convention is to put this list in a `requirements.txt` file:

`pip uninstall` followed by one or more package names will remove the packages from the virtual environment.

`pip show` will display information about a particular package:

### virtual enviroment

`pip freeze > requirements.txt`<br>
`cat requirements.txt`

    # Start the virtual enviroment
    python3 -m venv myproject

    # Activate the virtual enviroment
    cd myproject
    ls
    source bin/activate
    which python3
    ls -l \$(!!)

    # Install the packages
    python -m pip install torch
    # You can also install a specific version of a package by giving the package name followed by == and the version number:
    python -m pip install requests==2.6.0
    # If you re-run this command, pip will notice that the requested version is already installed and do nothing. You can supply a different version number to get that version, or you can run pip install --upgrade to upgrade the package to the latest version:
    python -m pip install --upgrade requests

    # Most convenient install
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

    deactivate
    which python3
