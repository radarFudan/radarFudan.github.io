Paper 2
[Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)

It is a minimax two-player game:

G: A generative model, capture the data distirbution

D: A discriminative model, estimates the probability that a sample came from the data distribution rather than G.

G's target is to maximize the probability for D to make a mistake. 

1. GSN

2. Adversarial nets framework does not require a Markov chain for sampling
