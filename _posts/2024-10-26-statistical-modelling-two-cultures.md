[Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-16/issue-3/Statistical-Modeling--The-Two-Cultures-with-comments-and-a/10.1214/ss/1009213726.full)

## Data Modelling

People usually assume that the data are geneated by a particular model. Then the conclusions are about the model's mechanism, and not about nature's mechanism. 

If the model is a poor emulation of nature, the conclusions may be wrong. 

Residual analysis come with the difficulty to uncover lack of fit in more than four to five dimensions. 

###  Multiplicity of data models

Data will often point with almost equal emphasis on several possible models, and it is important that the statistician recognize and accept this. 

### Algorithmic Modelling
